## About the Team  

We are a team of three young innovators, coming from different corners of Bangladesh. At first, each of us participated individually in many competitions across the country. Through those journeys, we eventually met one another, shared our dreams, and realised that together we could achieve something even greater. That was the beginning of our team.

From the very start, we have built a strong bond based on trust, hard work, and a shared passion for robotics. Step by step, we worked side by side and successfully won several national robotics competitions, which made us more confident about our vision.

A few months ago, we set ourselves a bigger goal‚Äîto represent Bangladesh in the World Robot Olympiad. Since then, we have been working with full dedication and determination. Our dream is simple but powerful: to raise the flag of Bangladesh high on the international stage and prove that with passion, teamwork, and belief, anything is possible.

## Differential Gear Mechanism

The **differential gear** is the core of our vehicle‚Äôs drift performance:
- **Herringbone Outer Gear:** Reduces axial thrust, improves torque distribution  
- **3D-Printed Precision:** Designed in SolidWorks, printed with high-resolution filament  
- **Smooth Drift Control:** Balances wheel speed during cornering  
- **Customizable:** Adjustable gear ratios for drift tuning  

<p align="center">
  <img src="other/dfaf80437e9cb2198109392ebfdeb3cd.jpg" alt="3D Differential Assembly" width="500"/>
</p>

> **Key Advantage:** Efficient power transmission with minimal slippage during drift maneuvers.

### Why a Differential Gear?
- Improves stability in high-speed drift  
- Reduces tire wear & drivetrain stress  
- Ensures smooth handling for navigation

## Differential Gear Conversion

We began with a ready-made RC differential:  

**Model:** Differential with Bearing 284010-2252  
**Application:** WLtoys 284010 / 284161 / K989 / 284131 (1/28 RC Car)  

The stock gear lacked torque efficiency for drifting.  
‚úÖ Solution: Converted it by designing a **3D-printed herringbone outer gear** in SolidWorks.
